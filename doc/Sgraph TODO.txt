(02G) When flag gives 'sample invalid' then skip these samples in graph.
      This can happen when part of the simultaneous updated samples is set to invalid,
      and allows for multiple sample rates in one write mechanism.
(02H) Min/Max background not yet perfect: when time jumps over large area, then max value
      jumps to next max value. Should be better to be limited and not jump over time gaps.
(02J) When preset is changed, then min/max indication is nok (not correct channels) until
      the preset is manually selected again. So after editting the Gviewer must be updated.
(03A) Ygraphs: select and place cursors
(06) Zoom max limits
(06A) Time max zoom span = 25 years & min = time - 10 years (or settable by rention time)
(02D) Add engineering units to Rscales
(02E) Add possibilities to show tagnames and descriptions in graph,
      place on track in 'empty spot' where no trace is plotted (automatically)
(06B) Time min zoom span = 2 samples LSB in data
(06C) Y max zoom span = all scales max range or default 10G
(07D) Y min zoom span = all scales min resolution or 1x10-12 span.
(07E) When Y-scale values are changed in graph manually then scaling is nok for that channel.
(08) Implement Export data to csv

(17) implement 'EAQ'
(18) implement string EAQ event list
(19) improve boolean TF visualization
(20) implement TDMS database class
(21) implement SQLite database class
(22) implement SQL database class
(25) Besides export: make live stream to custom code and 3D graph (as example)
(26) Implement Linux/Mac/Windows compatibility
23 jan 2022: added path adaption if OS != windows
     -> to be tested

------ Nice to Haves ------------
(103) Ability so add all Y axis scales at once
(105) Fix issues in example project. Make auto-deploy fast & easy
(106) Document the '105' auto deploy function.
(107) next.

------ BUGs ----Last update: 10 mar 2022

(23A) Database editor does not seem to work in executable that uses Packed Library.
(01G) When 1s/min updates: interpolation seems not to work OK
      Diagnose: 
(01I) min/max indicator not allways correct for all graphs
      For some it works, for others it doesnt (could  correlate with 01E bug)
(04A) Undo zoom works now, but the last step (to 0) contains a bug.
(13A) Toolbar hover when multiple instances interferes
 

================================================================
Items done:
================================================================
(01) Data fetch from disk
(01A)Buttons don't hold: bugfix needed
(01B) Disk fetch: only single file implemented; multiple files fail.
      Diagnose: (7/nov/21) recognized it with HV data conversion.
      The DB readback when crossover between two log files (days) is shows only one.
      This is important to fix as primary function to enable full readback
      -> Fixed 16-11-2021 for the 'per day' files (others not yet implemented for disk fetch)
      29 dec 2021: got this issue back into tht todo: 
      Whole data is not yet covered for readback, still gaps present..
      Next: Some scrolling bugs on L3/L3 present...
            This seems to be a pre-loading bug (missing a portion)
            Found: read from disk is 'read n samples' but should be 'read n samples from end'
            Fixed: 29 dec 2021
(01C) Bug: when hor resolution changes, then this is not updated to the Queries.
      Hor resolution change should do this immediately
      -> Fixed 16-11-2021
(01E) Disk fetch: 2 extra samples needed when fully zoomed in
      Even nicer would be: show where previous sample goes (time indicator)
      Fixed 2 extra samples, no indicator yet (time) for out of view samples.
(01F) Interpolation doesn't allways show correct, some channels interpolation = OFF
      Diagnose: Found the bug, fixed 16 nov 2021
(01H) Able to zoom out and not have working cursors anymore above a certain timespan.
      Setting: 10 msec sampling, 10 channels
      no cursors at approximately 30 minute timeline
      Diagnose: The 'LastUpdate.PAQ_section.DataSection' 1st element is NaN (date)
                then the DBL value will be 9.22337E+18.
      it's possible to fix this in the time comparator.
      Fixed in \Gview\methods\CursorDraw_3_cursorView.vi
      Tested: OK, now fixed.
(01J) Sometimes not the correct number of channels are shown... (when crowded..)
      Fixed: not seen for a while now..
(01K) Sometimes time goes to Zero (seen at L3) which gives incorrect displays on
      the graph. Fix attempt performed in (01S): Yes, this fixed it (2 jan 2022)
(01L) When hovering over traces in freeze, the min/max update does not change.
      Fixed 15 nov 2011 together with min-max settings options
(01M) Disk Fetch Per week must still be implemented.
      Fixed, 29 dec 2021
(01N) Disk Fetch per year must still be implemented.
      Fixed, 29 dec 2021
(01P) Graph buffer can run full when computer performance is not adequate.
      This will end after a while with a 'memory full' error making the system to hang.
      Solution: Sgraph should show it and act if needed (skip updates?)
      It also looks like during overload the graph events don't work.
      -> diagnose per 29 dec 2021 (since it is annoying..)
      29 dec 2021: visualized effect
      (01R) is means to fix the cause
      29 feb 2022: occasionly it still hangs... So add buffer size indicator
      Improved with flush action when buffer overflows, this seems to fix it.
(01Q) When (at i.e. L5) time is moved, then the image disappears until the dataset is
      selected again. 1st diagnose: Preset content is empty.
      Gottit: has to do with (01E), when during moving the content of the graph is empty,
      then the autoscale messes up and empties the settings values.
      So.. Fix for this bug would be to disable autoscale when there is no data,
      and fix the rest with fixing (01E).
      Fixed: 29 dec 2021
(01R) Decimate large sample sizes to prevent buffer overflow.
      Checked readout functions and found that time=zero cause much problems.
      Fast workaround is to skip time=0 files in BIN\PAQ_BIN_IndexRangeCheck.vi
      This still hasn't solved the time=0 effects, but gives better response.
      Fixed by time=0 fix, so this one skipped for now (2 jan 2022)
(01S) Sometimes it seems that time=0 is stored. Catch time=0 at the input (HISW)
      and block those. Then test if this fixes the problem.J
      New conversion test: 30 dec 2021 & Fixed
(01U) Graph seems not to be independent anymore, it seems they have used common resources.
      Reporoduce by starting multiple graphs and check that everyhing is independent.
      6 feb: fix cursor view common reponse: this is now fixed.
      Some dependency on periodic updates exist: Fixed, set all VI's to re-entrant-pre-assigned
(01W) Make Lscale and Rscale settings in menu.
      has also to do with item(101), (102) and (104), where (104) might also be auto-select.
      Implemented 10 feb 2022
(01Q) when in the Gviewer dataset editor the order of channels differs from the
      order in the database: then the visualization shows an error in the test shown
      at the cursor: so the lookup has a fault.
      Diagnose: Seems to be the TAG properties: this one needs a search per tag,
      just using the properties per index is wrong.
      Fixed: 3 mar 2022
(02) Show read mode in graph
(02A) When GViewer maximized: it does not update the Rscale and Lscale
      Also when turned On/Off it does not scale correct.
      First, move event action handler outside event handler, so it will run every loop iteration.
      Then: make timed handler for Lscale and Rscale updates.
      Works, timed event fixes the issue (6 mar 2022)
(02B) It would be nicer if Lscale and Rscale size would be exact as needed.
      Some estetic improvements can be implemented here
      Fixed on 7 mar 2022
(02C) Also save scale attributes together with presets.
      This would then also allow to make stacked view including all attibutes
      to become the default graph start view.
      8 mar 2022, start this action, but not completeley done yet ...
      Has still to be proper tested and all glitches removed..
      Some difficulties were found whith loading of presets..
      Found and fixed a 'selected properties' bug in autoscale VI
      fixed another bug in Preset load, now all OK
(02F) on library used application: Lplot Ygraphs do not show completely (missing one pixel)
      7 mar 2022 -> Changed location calculations, so I expect this is now fixed.
(03) Y-graphs
(04) Undo zoom
(05) Show dots at max zoom
(07) Show min/max background color
(07A) Min/Max: Update must be added in freeze mode
      Fixed 16 nov 2021
(12) Large range 'hang' bugfix
(14) Normalize 'stacked'
(15) Normalize 'listed'
(23) Add Almanac TAG features editor
(24) MinMax options
(101) Show actual values (on the right) -> implemented 19 feb 2022
(102) Ability to remove main left Y axis
      Done: 10 feb 2022
(104) Auto separate Y-axis on left side when appropriate.
      Note: regarded as too computing-intensive.
      It does work, but is not automatically turned on.
