# Sgraph
Storing and presenting measurement data

The Sgraph project is developed in LabVIEW 2020 32-bit

Sgraph is an instant LabVIEW based data historian and presentation utility.
The objective of Sgraph is to provide a fast way to add modern graphic presentation tools for storing and analyzing large amounts of acquired data.
Sgraph aims to turn coding of data viewers into a joyful browsing experience.

A pdf with a complete description is present in the repository in the doc section.

The objective of the project.
-Have a complete data storage and viewing library that is easy to implement, but abundant is functionality.
-Store everything (all channels) continuously without worrying 'what to log and what not'
-On any moment, view old or fresh sampled data on any resolution, from milliseconds up to years.
-Allow several file formats for storing (at time of first release: only one type is implemented)

Because not all classes are implemented yet, I still regard it as beta version (mar 2022) but since it works it might already be a breath of fresh air for who want to
search in large files, where the standard XY of waveform graph does not fit, or where large log files tend to overload you computer.
